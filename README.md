# THIS IS VERY OLD
This project is extremely old and anything you see in this repository is not a good representation of current skill, this was one of my first ever python projects so don't expect anything amazing. To get a better idea of where im at right now, check out my newest repositories.

# What is this?
This is my first real python project, it isn't very good since it's my first project written in python.

# So what's in it for me?
Well, i mostly made this for a space to store this code if i need to, but it has the benefit of being accessable to anyone as long as they comply with
the apache 2.0 license.
